# My-Codes
This repositary contains all the codes i wrote during my freshman year in C language for Fundamentals of Programming course.
I hope this will help those who are new in the programming world.

These codes are from my LABs,quizzes and some books like "C how to Program" , "C Programming: A Modern Approach" , "Learn C the Hard Way" and "Test your C skills".
